* Ledger Simulator

There is a simple simulator of a ledger that will use the same transaction rules
as the final chia network. It's intended to be used by those creating and testing
smart transactions.

Python 3.7 or later is required.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ python3 -m venv env

$ . activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

*Note* The requirements.txt is currently incomplete. Read the notes there to finish set-up.

- launch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ledger-sim -h
$ ledger-sim
#+END_SRC

If you don't specify a port, the default of 9868 will be selected automatically.
