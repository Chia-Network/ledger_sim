#+TITLE: Ledger Simulator
#+STARTUP: indent


* What is it?

This is a simple simulator of a ledger that will use the same transaction rules
as the final chia network. It's intended to be used by those creating and testing
smart transactions.

Python 3.7 or later is required.

* Launching

- create a virtual environment

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ ln -s env/bin/activate
$ . activate
$ pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

*Note* The ~-e~ flag installs in "editable mode" so you can quickly iterate with changes to
ledger-sim code. See [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#options][documentation]]
for more info.

- launch
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ledger-sim -h
$ ledger-sim
#+END_SRC

If you don't specify a port, the default of 9868 will be selected automatically.

- install ipython if necessary
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ pip install ipython
#+END_SRC
We need ipython because it allows ~await~ syntax on the command-line.

- test a client
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ipython
In [1]: from chiasim.clients.ledger_sim import connect_to_ledger_sim
In [2]: ledger_api = await connect_to_ledger_sim("localhost", 9868)
In [3]: await ledger_api.ping(m="foo")
Out[3]: {'response': "got ping message 'foo' at time 2019-07-17 21:20:49.133717"}
In [4]: await ledger_api.all_unspents()
In [5]: await ledger_api.get_tip()
{'tip_hash': <HeaderPointer: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>,

#+END_SRC


- create and spend a coin
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ipython
from chiasim.hack.keys import conditions_for_payment, puzzle_hash_for_index, spend_coin
from chiasim.clients.ledger_sim import connect_to_ledger_sim

ledger_api = await connect_to_ledger_sim("localhost", 9868)
coinbase_puzzle_hash = puzzle_hash_for_index(0)
fees_puzzle_hash = puzzle_hash_for_index(1)
r = await ledger_api.next_block(coinbase_puzzle_hash=coinbase_puzzle_hash, fees_puzzle_hash=fees_puzzle_hash)
body = r["body"]
conditions = conditions_for_payment([(puzzle_hash_for_index(2), 1000)])
tx = spend_coin(body.coinbase_coin, conditions, 0)
r = await ledger_api.push_tx(tx=tx)
